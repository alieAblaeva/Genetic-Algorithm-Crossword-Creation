# Crossword Puzzle Generator using Genetic Algorithm

## Overview

This Python program utilizes a genetic algorithm to generate a crossword puzzle from a given list of words. The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of crossword configurations towards an optimal solution, where each configuration represents a potential crossword layout.

## Features

- **Initialization**: The program initializes a population of crossword configurations randomly or using heuristics.
- **Evaluation**: Each crossword configuration is evaluated based on criteria such as word intersection count, word placement fitness, and overall puzzle fitness.
- **Selection**: A selection mechanism, such as tournament selection is employed to choose the most fit crossword configurations for reproduction.
- **Crossover**: Crossword configurations selected for reproduction undergo crossover to produce offspring configurations with traits inherited from their parents.
- **Mutation**: Offspring configurations undergo mutation to introduce diversity and prevent premature convergence.
- **Termination**: The genetic algorithm iterates until a termination condition is met, such as reaching a maximum number of generations or achieving a satisfactory puzzle fitness.
- **Output**: The program outputs the final crossword puzzle layout along with the words used and their positions.
